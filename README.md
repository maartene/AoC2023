# AoC2023

Advent of Code 2023. First time participating! ðŸŽ‰

## Input files

The creator of the Advent of Code site requested for the input files not to be shared. So they are part of the `.gitignore` file.

Within each day project, you should create an `Input.swift` file where you add a `let input = """ """` with the input for that day.

## Day specific remarks

- Day 10: My solution assumes the input is padded with one extra '.' at the top, left, bottom and right of the input matrix.

### Note

The tests that validate the actual input (usually called `test_part1` and `test_part2`) validate against the input I received. You might get different input, meaning the expected output value will be different.
