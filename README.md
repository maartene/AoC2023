Advent of Code 2023

## Input files
The creator of the Advent of Code site requested for the input files not to be shared. So they are part of the `.gitignore` file.

Within each day project, you should create an `Input.swift` file where you add a `let input = """ """` with the input for that day.

### Note
The tests that validate the actual input (usually called `test_part1` and `test_part2` validate against the input I received. You might get different input, meaning the expected output value will be different.
